        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>Oyakodon is a traditional Japanese dish that takes its
            English translation quite literally. <strong>"Oya"</strong> which means parent and <strong>"Ko"</strong> 
            meaning child. It has chicken pieces cooked in a pan along with eggs to make a delicious combination.
            Served on top of rice and garnished with some green onion.
        </p>

        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken thighs</strong> - Recommend this over chicken breasts because the fattier thighs are more flavorful, tender, and forgiving (not like dry, overcooked breasts).</li>
            <li><strong>Sake</strong> - Drizzling a tablespoon of sake over chicken helps remove its gamey odor.</li>
            <li><strong>Onion</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Mitsuba</strong> - This Japanese wild parsley has a celery-like flavor with a slightly bitter taste. This garnish is used quite often in donburi (rice bowls) dishes.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: Dashi (Japanese soup stock), soy sauce, mirin, and sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Steamed rice</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Shichimi Togarashi</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the ingredients: cut the onion, mitsuba/green onions, and chicken and crack the eggs.</li>
            <li>Cook the onion in the seasoning mixture.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken and cook until no longer pink.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the egg mixture at two seperate times. Garnish mitsuba/green onions.</li>
            <li>Spoon the finished dish over the bed of steamed rice in a donburi bowl.</li>
        </ol>
