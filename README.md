This will be practice for using HTML by making a website for recipes.
Will demonstrate how to make the html files and pages along with any links, images, and source codes along the way. With text it will demonstrate how to bold, itilicize, put into paragraphs, and allow for people with disabilities to navigate the site with ease.
The website will have a main index page as well as a few links that will go to recipes.
